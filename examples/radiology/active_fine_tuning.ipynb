    "Here we will explore the ideas from `EFFICIENTLY LEARNING AT TEST-TIME: ACTIVE FINE-TUNING OF LLMS` from Jonas Hubotter, Sascha Bongni, Ido Hakimi, and Andreas Krause. The paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08020) and repo is [here](https://github.com/jonhue/activeft). The idea is to fine tune at test time on a small sample of data. Of particular interest is the sample of data that is used. Rather than typical retrieval where nearest neighbors are selected from the embedding space, they introduce a more data efficient method of selecting data. This is useful not only for retraining, but also for RAG type applications."
